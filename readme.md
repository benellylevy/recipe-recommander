# Recipe Recommender ‚Äì Smart Cooking From Your Fridge

This project started with a simple question: what if my fridge could help me decide what to cook? I wanted to build something real, not just a toy. So I made this. Sometimes, you open the fridge and have no idea what to cook. This app helps you solve that by suggesting recipes based on what you actually have in your kitchen.

Here‚Äôs how it works: you enter three ingredients you have on hand, choose your diet preferences (like vegan or not), select any food allergies or intolerances you have, and pick your favorite cooking style or cuisine. The app then talks to the Spoonacular API to find recipes that match your inputs.

One cool feature is real-time spell checking and correction for your ingredients, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about typos messing up your search.

The app fetches a list of recipes and ranks them by how many ingredients you already have, making it easier for you to cook without extra shopping.
